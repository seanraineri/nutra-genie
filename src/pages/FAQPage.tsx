            We provide personalized supplement recommendations based on your unique health data—lab tests, genetic information (optional), and health goals. Our AI analyzes these factors to suggest vitamins, minerals, and other supplements best suited for you.

          <AccordionContent>
            Unlike generic quiz-based sites, we use real data from your lab tests and potentially genetic results to deliver evidence-based, dynamic recommendations that update over time as your health data changes.
